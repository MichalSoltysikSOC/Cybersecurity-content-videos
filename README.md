Michał Sołtysik - Deep packet inspection analyses - why the typical approach is not enough (ENG):

Title of the lecture: Deep packet inspection analyses: why the typical approach is not enough.

Description of the lecture: There is an unquestionable need to perform regular deep packet inspection analyses, i.e. network edge profiling. Providing standard SOC type services that use tools, such as SIEM, SOAR, IPS, WAF, EDR and others leads to a partial waste of human resources due to the constant dealing with the so-called "false positives". The cybersecurity industry is currently characterized by superficiality, insufficient competence and low cyber awareness. Cybercriminals are in possession of hundreds of mechanisms that they regularly take advantage of to break through firewalls. In this lecture, I will present an advanced view of the realities that teams such as SOC are unable to deal with, and explain why this is the case. I will use extensive knowledge of a variety of threats, based on analysis of 252 different network protocols from the areas of IT, OT and IoT.

Content:

Example number 1 - based on different level monitoring of HTTP traffic through SIEM system vs. DPI analysis on the example of RCE - Unauthorized User Account Creation vulnerability.

Example number 2 - based on File Upload / RCE vulnerability and HTTP traffic.

Example number 3 - based on TCP, FTP, DNS, PNIO, ICMP, RTCP, UDP, ICP, NBNS and SNMP traffic.

Example number 4 - based on RTT Measurements during DoS / DDoS cyber attacks.

Example number 5 - based on Modbus/TCP, WTP, H.225.0 RAS, GTP, RTCP and PFCP traffic.

Example number 6 - based on GTP, TIPC and CIGI traffic.

Example number 7 - based on ADwin and BAT_GW traffic.

Example number 8 - based on RCE vulnerability and MANOLITO and EtherCAT traffic.

Michał Sołtysik - Remcos RAT threat analysis on Windows including IEC 60870-5-104 traffic (ENG):

Title of the lecture: Remcos RAT threat analysis on Windows including, surprisingly enough, IEC 60870-5-104 traffic.

Description of the lecture: Typically, malware uses popular protocols such as HTTP or TLS to exfiltrate data. However, Remcons uses IEC 60870 part 5, which provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems usually in electrical engineering and power system automation, for that very reason.
